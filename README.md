Client Server App for Appointments

Every Friday we make a breakfast with ground pork buns
For better Planning how much prked grounds we have to buy, i made an webApp 

The Client is written in Angular2 wiht angular-cli
The Server runs on nodejs with express, Mongod and passport for authentication

To run this Project , you have to do some manual steps until the full setup script is ready
</br>
1.) Install and run MongoDB on your Client or install it somewhere else </br>
2.) Clone the Repository and run npm install in the client and in the server folder</br>
3.) To run the Client navigate to the client folder and type in ng serve (Debug Server) or ng build (Minify and copy all to dist folder)</br>
4.) To run the server just type in node server.js, the Server then is available at http://localhost:3000</br>
